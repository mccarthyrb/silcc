The edit/change history in the files generally used only initials, which
makes identification rather tricky after twenty or thirty years.  Our best
guesses for mapping the initials onto full names are given below.  Some of
these mappings may be wrong, and a few are unknown at this late date (2015).
There may have been others who contributed to this code, but these are all
that were listed in the history sections of the various files.

The original C code was converted from Pascal code written in 1983.  The
Pascal program was a reimplementation of an earlier program written in PTP,
a Teco-like programming language invented and implemented for 8080 based
microcomputers by Gary Simons in the late 1970s and reimplemented for RT-11
and MSDOS by Stephen McConnel.
